**Thank you for joining us for AXIS! Over the course of several weeks in August, we will come together to map privacy and security tools being used by at-risk organizations and identify concrete ways that we can support improvements to those tools. Through live sessions, podcasts, blog posts, and recorded content, participants will explore the process of feedback collection and build their own skills and knowledge. On average, we will ask participants to commit 4-6 hours per week reviewing content or joining live sessions. The full agenda can be found below. Please check back here each week throughout the event for updated content!**

**Developing User Personas and Organizational Archetypes** *(Thursday, August 13)*

- This will be an interactive session where participants work together to develop user personas and organizational archetypes. These resources play an important role in the design process and allow developers to better understand community needs.

## Community-led sessions

- **Conducting User Research** Cecilia Maundu (in collaboration with Okthanks) will be facilitating the **9:00 AM ET** session. Driven to ensure that the voices of her community are heard, Cecilia has taken upon herself to learn user research. She will be walking us through her experience and creating space to discuss challenges and cultural differences that exist when conducting research.
- **Identity: A Role Play Game** During the **9:00 PM ET** session, Sage Cheng (who leads design and UX work at Access Now) and Mona Wang (a security researcher at Princeton CITP) will facilitate “Identity: A Role Play Game”. Identity management has become a surviving skill in today's online world. This game is designed to help understand the scope of one's online identity and map out strategies to protect against adversaries.
