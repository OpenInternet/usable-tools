**USABLE succeeds as a program by bringing varied lived experiences and voices to the forefront of a global discussion. As such, we expect all attendees to be respectful of others, appreciate differences of opinion, and to communicate clearly.**

All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at USABLE hosted events (including the UXForum, Organizational Security Village, USABLE trainings and workshops, and all side events) are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe  environment for everybody.

Any violations may be brought to the event organizers directly or via email to *support@usable.tools* .  PGP encryption is supported, please encrypt to [Ashley Fowler](mailto:afowler@internews.org) and/or [Jon Camfield](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xA998959FF926BF8B). At in-person events, conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.

## Sharing and Privacy Policies

The event will set ground rules collaboratively to manage private information throughout the event, which will include guidelines on social media, photos, and sharing information.

*The UXForum will be creating public resources, and there will be public-facing events held in conjunction with the Forum which are not mandatory.

## Anti-Harassment policy

All USABLE hosted events are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, pregnancy/maternity status, marriage/civil partnership status, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. <!--unless you use vim ;) -->

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, particularly those related to personal aspects listed above.
* Inappropriate photography or recording.
* Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments, jokes, and imagery; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

*Violations of these may result in expulsion from the event.*

### Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
