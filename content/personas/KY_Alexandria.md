## Overview

Alexandria is based in Nairobi, Kenya. She is married and in her late twenties with a young child. She is a **lawyer** by profession, but is also a **champion of women's rights**. She has been very vocal about FGM and has received some backlash for her activism.

As part of her anti-FGM work, Alexandria uses an application that enables volunteers to rescue young girls and relocate them. Alexandria is responsible for **coordinating the volunteers.**


## Goals

I need to be able to **track** the movement to my volunteers.

I need an application which has an **emergency button** for when there is no time to communicate.


## Threats

Alexandria's child has been downloading apps on her phone without her knowledge. The downloaded software included **malware,** which **compromised sensitive information** stored on her device. The malware is also capable of downloading and installing other apps and can do so without detection. Alexandria does not know how much information has been **leaked** so far, but the volunteers are vulnerable to attacks since their identities have been revealed.


## Strengths

Alexandria makes sure that her software is always updated.

She also makes sure that all volunteer files are **encrypted** and is able to use the application to spread her message and get more people involved in anti-FGM efforts.


## Questions

Can I still **safely** use my phone after deleting all the apps?

What can I do to **avoid** such incidents in the future?
