## Overview

Marwa is a 20-year-old journalist who grew up in Syria, later moving to a neighboring country due to increased violence in her region.

This experience has made her **resilient and quick to adapt**. Although she has fled the physical danger of conflict in Syria, she now faces new threats because of her profession, from **targeted surveillance** to **advanced malware**, as well as an increasing number of border skirmishes and **assassination attempts** on journalists.

She uses a wide-range of applications, but most notably Facebook, to share her stories with a broader audience inside and outside of Syria. She is often willing to take risks and has been **desensitized** to a point where securing her data is not a high priority most of the time.


## Goals

She needs to **communicate and share** what is happening in Syria as efficiently as she can, sometimes as a form of criticism or dissent, but mostly to **disseminate information** and **raise awareness**.

She also requires regular communication with her **vast network** of friends and followers (some of whom she does not necessarily know personally).


## Threats

**Phishing attacks** and **malware** exposure to her devices both from **state and non-state actors**.

**Surveillance** of her communication by both the hostcountry and Syria and **misinformation** about their capabilities.

**Imprisonment** and unintentionally putting others at risk through their connection with her, particularly family.

Revealing networks due to **device confiscation**.


## Strengths

**Fearless journalist** with a strong voice and a powerful message.

Very **adaptable** to a range of circumstances.

Committed to returning home and supporting her people in the meantime.


## Questions

How can I trust that what you’re telling me is true?

How do I **secure my social networks**? And how can communicate with my network if they don’t use a particular tool?

Getting my message out is more important than security. What are some ways I can **balance** this?

How can I protect myself and my friends?
