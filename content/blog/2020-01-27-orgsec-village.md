Internews is pleased to host the Organizational Security Village at the [Internet Freedom Festival](https://internetfreedomfestival.org/) this year. This two-day event (April 23 and 24) will bring together digital security trainers, security auditors, and other experts and practitioners for lightning talks, interactive workshops, collaborative discussions, and relevant hands-on labs and skill-shares.

### Add Usability to the Agenda!

In addition to some more traditional "OrgSec" ideas for this village; we are seeking specific user feedback on both the [SAFETAG framework](https://SAFETAG.org) (how it works, how the content is presented, etc.) and are also looking to identify critical usability gaps in organization-level security tools - what is needed and how are organizations currently managing secure collaboration needs?

Please complete [this application](https://forms.gle/AiLgB9PHdq3ka3Tt9) to propose sessions or topics that you would like to explore further. Deadline for submission is **February 28, 2020**. All selected submissions will be notified by March 20, 2020.

*We look forward to seeing you there!*
