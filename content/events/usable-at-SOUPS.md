### The USABLE Project team will host a workshop at [SOUPS 2019](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2019)!

This workshop will cover how to adapt UX design and user feedback collection techniques when working with high-risk communities, through an overview of the different marginalized groups and their needs that the USABLE.tools project have worked with from around the world over the past 2 years.

The USABLE.tools project builds feedback loops around the globe by connecting at-risk communities with digital security trainers, usability experts, and security tool developers. USABLE has worked with over 50 trainers and engaged end users in high-risk areas, and supported open source security and privacy tools with funding as well as direct design and implementation support to take this feedback and incorporate it into their tools through human-centered design processes.

Representatives from the project will discuss their methodology and outcomes from working with regional and local digital security trainers from around the world to gather feedback and build personas to represent marginalized, vulnerable, and other at-risk communities.

### Call for Presentations

We welcome community input (via a simplified Call for Papers/Projects) to present on similar topics and then via breakout groups discuss open questions around building lasting structures to help designers and tool developers responsibly solicit and implement feedback from at-risk populations.

Please submit a short summary (less than 1000 words, approximately 2 pages) of your work, with references/websites/papers linked if relevant, and what topic you'd want to present on during the workshop to Connect+CFP@usable.tools, plaintext/markdown formats preferred, PGP keys for encryption available on request.

* Workshop paper submission deadline: Friday, May 30, 2019
* Workshop paper acceptance notification to authors: Saturday, June 8, 2019
* Workshop camera-ready papers due: Wednesday, June 19, 2019
