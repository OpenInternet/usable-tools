  <h2>Archetypes</h2>
  The USABLE project created a series of <em>archetypes</em>. Those are fictional profiles which can guide your security planning and decision-making. Adversary archetypes can illuminate the various motivations, favored means of attack, and resources being used by malicious actors without naming or identifying specific adversaries, which can be dangerous for at-risk organizations or communities. Organizational archetypes, on the other hand, highlight patterns in the circumstances of real organizations rather than basing the resource on any single organizationâ€™s experience. They therefore provide critical information without increasing risk by identifying particular organizations.
