**Thank you for joining us for AXIS. Over the course of several weeks in August, we will come together to map privacy and security tools being used by at-risk organizations and identify concrete ways that we can support improvements to those tools. Through live sessions, podcasts, blog posts, and recorded content, participants will explore the process of feedback collection and build their own skills and knowledge. On average, we will ask participants to commit 4-6 hours per week reviewing content or joining live sessions. The full agenda can be found below. Please check back here each week throughout the event for updated content!**


# Weekly Schedule

## Week One

Many of the most at-risk communities around the globe rely on open
source privacy and security tools. However, these tools are often
designed, developed, and maintained by individuals or small teams who
have little to no access to their target audience — journalists,
activists, human rights defenders, and other high-risk groups. This
often results in tools that poorly fit the threats, challenges, and/or
accessibility or usability requirements of end-users.

Internews and the USABLE Team have worked with many community members
across the globe to support tool developers who want to better
understand their users’ needs, security practices, and operating
environment, establishing stronger feedback loops between the
communities who make the tools and the communities who use them. Since
2015, the USABLE project has worked with over 50 trainers from around
the globe, 11 designers and UX experts, and 7 open source tool teams who
build products that focus on privacy and security for high-risk
communities to develop and test these feedback collection activities.

## Week Two

**When developers receive feedback and insights into end-users’ needs, practices, and operating environments, they are able to employ more *human-centered design* approaches, resulting in usable and accessible products that reflect the needs of real users.**

The UX Feedback Collection Guidebook aims to facilitate feedback loops between users and tool developers by equipping digital security trainers and other trusted facilitators with the skills and resources they need to:

1.  Safely gather information around end-users’ needs, practices, and
    operating environments
2.  Collect tool-specific feedback from at-risk users
3.  Synthesize, prioritize, and structure information or feedback
4.  Share information or feedback with relevant developers or tool teams

The guidebook is broken down into four **thematic sections**:

*   Part I: Collecting Feedback to Better Understand the User
*   Part II: Collecting Tool-specific Feedback During Trainings
*   Part III: Collecting Feedback Outside of Trainings
*   Part IV: Communicating with Developers and Tool Teams

## Who should use it?


The guidebook can be used by a variety of practitioners including **digital security trainers** (new or experienced), **user-experience (UX) specialists**, trusted **facilitators**, and **open source tool teams**.
