## Background

Valeria is a young independent journalist who collaborates with different
national and international digital media and in her free time she collaborates
in investigations with some NGOs, especially those that work on issues of
feminism, LGBTIQ+ rights and freedom of expression. She has been injured during
coverage of popular demonstrations and threatened by armed groups in her
community, who are close to the regime and seek to intimidate dissidents in
order to silence them.


## Technology use

Instant messaging apps for communicating with her loved ones and coworkers,
video calling platforms for work, and email for professional and personal use.
Due to the heavy censorship in the country, she must use a VPN to access
various web pages.


## Goals

Report what is happening in the country.

Overcome censorship and attempts to limit access to information.

Fight against the disinformation and propaganda of the regime.


## Threats

Repressive context for freedom of expression (freedom of expression has been criminalized).

High crime rates in the areas she frequents.

Gender-based violence.


## Strengths

Alliances with other journalists and organizations.

Advanced communication skills.

Social capital and influence in social media.


## Questions

How can we increase the security of our social media accounts?

What are some more secure means of messaging that I can use to maintain contact with collaborators, colleagues, and family?

What security tools can we use in spaces with low connectivity?
