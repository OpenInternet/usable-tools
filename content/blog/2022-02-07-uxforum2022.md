## The UXForum is back, April 25-29, 2022!!

A virtual convening to explore human-rights centered design in the open source privacy and security community

Join human rights defenders, digital security trainers, auditors, software developers and designers for a multi-day, online event that will provide space for skill-building, networking, sharing best practices, and exploring opportunities for collaboration.

Help us shape the agenda by [submitting a session proposal](https://forms.gle/u4tpcYA6uexpNUv48)! The call for proposals will remain open until March 11, 2022 and we will notify applicants of selection no later than March 25, 2022.

We encourage you to put in a session regardless of your experience leading sessions in other circumstances. Likewise, if you’ve got a great idea but still need to work on the details, we encourage you to submit a session and join us in mid-February for our open information session (date forthcoming) to ask questions, discuss your idea, and receive feedback.

In the meantime, don’t forget to [register for the forum](https://forms.gle/hfD9sG5RkEN7oJLf6) (registration closes on April 15, 2022) and follow us on [Twitter @USABLE_tools](https://twitter.com/USABLE_tools/) for the latest updates.

The event will be guided by the USABLE [code of conduct](https://usable.tools/coc/).
