## Background

Carolina is a journalist who lives in Los Andes region and is a correspondent
for several digital media, some with their headquarters in Caracas. Most of the
news that she covers is related to the humanitarian emergency: food shortages,
failures in public services and health system.

**Relevant recent events**: Like most people who live outside of the capital
city Caracas, most of the time she does not have an internet connection due to
ISP failures or the frequent and prolonged power outages.


## Technology use

Due to constant power failures and the cost of alternative ISPs, Carolina
relies almost entirely on her cell phone to get her work done. She receives
most of her inputs on WhatsApp and she writes the news on her computer using
data shared from her cell phone.


## Goals

Overcome the censorship imposed by the national government.

Inform communities with little or no access to independent media.

Bring useful information to the masses so that they can be informed.


## Threats

Lack of infrastructure / equipment to get the job done.

Arbitrary detentions.

Physical and digital attacks by state security forces or irregular armed groups.


## Strengths

Reliable coworkers that support each other to overcome deficiencies.

International cooperation resources to acquire new equipment.

Interest and motivation to learn.


## Questions

How can I implement the recommendations if I don't have electricity or internet?

Can communication apps like WhatsApp or Telegram be hacked?

How can I safely document human rights violations?
