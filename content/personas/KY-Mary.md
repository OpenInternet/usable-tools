## Overview

Paul is LGBTI in Uganda, where it is **illegal** and not socially accepted. He faces both **ostracism and physical risk.**

Paul and his organization work with politicians and civil society leaders to improve the acceptance of LGBTI issues across Uganda.

Paul is currently leading an internal project at his organization to improve their **security practices** - both at the organization and at many staff members' homes, they have biometric alarm systems installed after a series of break-ins and office raids where laptops were stolen. Other practices Paul is working to address are sharing laptops in the office and discouraging using cybercafes.

Paul is between 29 and 35. He is single and lives alone, as his close family have emigrated.


## Goals

Keeping himself and his colleagues safe -- both at their office and their homes

Maintaining ability to **advocate** for social change

Ability to have an active social and family life


## Threats

Strong social norms against LGBTI - including everyday people, religious fundamentalists, police with prejudices, and **illegality**

Office and home **raids and robberies;** including the seizure of laptops. Stolen information can be sold to the media, which "out" activists publicly

Intense government **surveillance** of activist and NGO activity using powerful tools


## Strengths

Paul has readily adopted many digital security practices - enabling **two factor authentication** for accounts

Paul has developed complex **operational security** practices, such as having personal protocols of how to engage with new contacts in public spaces instead of at the office, to reduce associational risk.

After recent office raids, Paul and other staff have moved to saving documents in cloud storage and not on laptops.


## Questions

How do I **protect information** against my devices being confiscated?

How do I encourage colleagues, partners, and funders to adopt better security practices?
