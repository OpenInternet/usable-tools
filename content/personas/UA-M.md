## Overview

Masha is based in Kyiv, and works for an NGO tracking **human rights violations** ocurring in the contested Donetsk region of Eastern Ukraine.

She coordinates monitoring missions of volunteers who travel into Donetsk to interview and document violations using their **cell phones**, and return to **share and organize the information**. Her responsibility is to plan the missions and logistics, select and send volunteers to the area, and **monitor their work and safety**.

Masha is an **experienced user** of digital security tools, including **encrypted email** and **password managers**.

However, the volunteer network she works with has high turn-over, and different skill levels and understanding of digital security.


## Goals

She needs the ability to **track the volunteers' movement** in the area in real time.

A fast, safe tool to synchronize data from volunteer smartphones, so the data does not get **confiscated and lost**.

Volunteers need an **"SOS" button** for when there is no time to communicate, but need to send an alert.


## Threats

The documentation the volunteers gather is **very sensitive** to both sides of the conflict; neither side wants these facts.

To preserve the information and keep the volunteers safe, they need to **remove the data from the mobile phone** as fast as possible, as the **devices may be seized** at any moment.

The situation in Donetsk is **unpredictable**, and communications channels may go down without warning.


## Strengths

Advanced user who has been trained in and adopted digital security methods. She has **different passwords** for different services, and **updates her software** regularly.

She uses **file encryption** for files on her laptop, and uses gmail with **two-factor authentication** for her email.

The volunteers have **widely different levels** of tech skills and need tools which are **fast to learn** and **easy to use**.


## Questions

What happens to the information if the **mobile phone is confiscated**?

Can it work if **communications are blocked** or completely cut off?

How can I safely **track the location** of the volunteers without revealing that information to anyone else?
