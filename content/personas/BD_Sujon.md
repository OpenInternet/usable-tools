## Overview

Habibur is in his twenties and identifies as a **Muslim gay** man. He lives in a small town where he must constantly hide his sexuality. Recently, Habibur went to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, to attend a party for gay men. Police **raided** the party and he and some of his friends were **arrested**. The police outed them as gay men in front of the media.

Habibur has an **"anonymous" Facebook profile** that he uses to connect with other gay men. He is an active member of a closed Facebook group for gay Bangladesh men. He often **attends events** that are posted in this group. Many people do not have access to a smart phone in his remote village, so he relies on Facebook groups to stay connected to other people in the LGBT community.


## Goals

Habibur needs to be able to **connect** with other members of the LGBT community, without fearing for his safety.

He is interested in learning more about how to **safely** use online dating tools.


## Threats

Habibur's **identity was revealed** when he was **arrested** during the raid of a party. Bullying and social harassment increased significantly following this incident, particularly within his university.

LGBT people are extremely **vulnerable** when using social media or dating applications.

Many of the risk mitigation materials that currently exist are only available in English. Habibur only speaks Bangla and therefore has **limited resources** available to protect himself.


## Strengths

Habibur owns a smart phone and knows how to use **mobile applications**.

He understands the basics of the Internet and he is able to **send and receive emails**.


## Questions

How can I **safely navigate** Facebook groups and dating applications for the LGBT
community?

Are there **risk mitigation materials** available in my native language of Bangla?
