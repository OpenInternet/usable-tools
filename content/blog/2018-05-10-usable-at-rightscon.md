In response to the emerging security and privacy concerns in product and user experience design, we would like to invite you to the [UX/Tech Meetup at RightsCon Toronto](https://rightscon2018.sched.com/event/Eo4i/uxtech-meetup-at-rightscon) on behalf of Internews and Access Now.

This meetup will be on Thursday, May 17th, 2018 from 1:20pm to 2:20pm in Demo Room.

Our theme for the meetup is how technologies can better protect peopleâ€™s digital rights with user research and strategic design thinking. We are hoping to connect talents across sectors, share experience and lessons from existing projects, and combine efforts and identify collaboration opportunities. If you have any ideas you would like to share or topics to discuss, you are more than welcome to bring them to the meetup.
