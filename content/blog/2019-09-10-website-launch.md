New USABLE Website

We’re excited to announce the launch of our re-designed USABLE website!

This new site features a clear breakdown of the USABLE project, including descriptions of the various communities we partner with in different capacities. Visitors can easily navigate through user personas, explore USABLE’s involvement at recent events, and find out more about the organizations we work with.

Throughout the month of September, we will be featuring guest blog posts from some of our partners including [Okthanks](https://okthanks.com), [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org), [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org), and [Accessibility Lab](https://a11ylab.com).

To check out the full site, visit [https://usable.tools](https://usable.tools).

**A huge thank you to Justin DeBlois for the design of the site, and Squiggy Rubio for development!**
