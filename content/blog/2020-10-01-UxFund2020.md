We are excited to announce the launch of the latest round of the UXFund, a targeted pool of funding dedicated to improving the usability of open source security and privacy tools used by at-risk communities around the globe.

Developers, maintainers, and other representatives of open source tool teams are invited to apply on behalf of an open source privacy and security tool. Winning applications must demonstrate a commitment to high-impact usability solutions, and incorporate human-centered design principles, including user testing, engagement with end-users, as well as a willingness to work directly with digital security trainers and auditors around the globe. The goal of this funding is to support stronger feedback loops among tool teams and their target user base, and ultimately make tools more usable for those who need them most.

The majority of the UXFund will support work addressing the needs of at-risk persons and/or vulnerable populations (e.g. ethnic minorities, LGBTQI communities, people with disabilities, and women), but there are limited funds available for deeper tool re-architecture, if clear usability-enhancing outputs are presented.

This round of the UXFund will also prioritize tools or platforms that apply to address unique challenges that are faced at the organization or community level, such as shared password management or encrypted collaboration tools.

The amount of funding provided will vary based on the specific needs of the tool, but will likely range from $5,000 to $50,000 USD. The funding period will likely span from November 2020 through June 2021.
