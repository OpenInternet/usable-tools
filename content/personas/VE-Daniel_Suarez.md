## Background

Daniel is a journalist who lives in Caracas. He works as a reporter for digital
media. Most of the time he is on the street documenting the news from various
sectors of the city and at the end of the day he returns to the office for the
coordination meeting that he holds with the rest of his co-workers.

**Relevant recent events**: A few months ago, government offcials raided the
office for no apparent reason, Daniel feels that he must be very vigilant about
protecting the information on his phone and on the office computer.


## Technology use

Daniel has had digital security training in the past on behalf of the media he
represents, so he uses strong passwords and in some cases activates double
factor authentication. Most of his teammates have not received training.


## Goals

Overcome the censorship imposed by the national government.

Inform communities with little or no access to independent media.

Make the general crisis in the country visible.


## Threats

Physical and digital attacks by state security forces.

Website and social media blocking.

Arbitrary detentions.


## Strengths

Interest and motivation to learn new ways on how to protect himself and others
around him.

International cooperation resources to acquire new equipment.

The organization as a whole has an interest in promoting organizational security policies.


## Questions

What communication channels can and can’t the government intervene and how can I protect myself?

What is the safest place to store documents?

What special security measures must be taken into consideration while investigating sensitive topics such as corruption schemes?
