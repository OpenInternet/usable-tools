# Organizational Archetypes

Organizational archetypes are fictional profiles that capture the complex capacities, needs, and risks of organizations and communities. By highlighting patterns in the circumstances of real organizations rather than basing the resource on any single organizationâ€™s experience, archetypes provide critical information without increasing risk by identifying them specifically.

Organizational archetypes can serve as an educational resource within organizations and communities, enabling users to discuss and identify security vulnerabilities and challenges they face in order to allocate resources and respond accordingly. In addition, they serve as a communication tool for organizations and communities to articulate their threats and needs to funders and other community members in a safe, anonymized way.

*&lowast; Please note, organizational archetypes can be representative of formally registered organizations, non-registered organizations, communities, groups of people with shared goals, coalitions, networks, etc.*
