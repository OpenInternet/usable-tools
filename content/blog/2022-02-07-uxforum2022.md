## The UXForum is back, April 25-29, 2022!!

A virtual convening to explore human-rights centered design in the open source privacy and security community

Join human rights defenders, digital security trainers, auditors, software developers and designers for a multi-day, online event that will provide space for skill-building, networking, sharing best practices, and exploring opportunities for collaboration.

We encourage you to put in a session regardless of your experience leading sessions in other circumstances. Likewise, if you’ve got a great idea but still need to work on the details, we encourage you to submit a session and join us for our open information session Friday, February 25, 2022 at 8:00 am EST or 11:00 am EST to ask questions, discuss your idea, and receive feedback. Links to the sessions will be provided once you [sign up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaI5KcWwPFo9wIj3iBUoub6XEr992oGVbZCJES73CVJcYaOw/viewform).
