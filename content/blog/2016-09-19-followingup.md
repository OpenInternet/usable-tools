We can't believe it's been two months since the UXForum!  To be fair, we had a lot of sleep to catch up on, and there have been some exciting staff transitions over on our team.

Going forward, Megan (Megan@usable.tools) will be leading USABLE while Jon takes on directorship of our global portfolio (including supporting USABLE!).  We are also onboarding additional program support to help out.

We've added a massive <a href="/resources">Resources page</a> that captures a ton of links and references from the UXForum, our reading lists, and more.

We also have some new <a href="/personas">User Personas</a> we've put together from the UXForum and TFT work with our communities.  These personas represent a wide variety of users of digital security tools facing a mix of threat actors.

We have created these from many common shared experiences, but for the privacy of our communities, none are 1:1 connected, and all are created from a combination of people and the work they do.  The photos are public domain or Creative Commons stock photography, and the names are of course made up.

We are working with a few teams to support UX walkthroughs, accessibility, and user testing of open source digital secutrity tools!  We will be focusing on our UXFund grantees first, but please ping us at <a href="mailto:connect@usable.tools">connect@usable.tools</a> if you are a tool developer and are interested in this -- and also check Open Technology Fund's <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/lab/usability-lab" target="_blank">Usability Lab</a> they run in partnership with <a href="https://simplysecure.org">SimplySecure</a>.
