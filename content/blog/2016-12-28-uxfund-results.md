The USABLE team is proud to announce the UXFund results for the small, but targeted usability enhancement grants. Many great proposals were received and, after a thorough review process, five organizations for short-term awards were selected. A core component of all grants will be to more directly engage and listen to users, so tool creators can better understand and implement usability improvements that are needed from high-risk communities across the globe.

Profiles of the UXFund grantees can be found below:
