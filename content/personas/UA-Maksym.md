## Overview

Maksym is in his late twenties and works as a history teacher in Ukraine. During his free time, **he works as an admin and editor for a social media page** of a local activist group. The group fights against city gentrification and the destruction of local parks for residential development.

He uses his Laptop to access his personal pages and advocacy groups on **Facebook** and **VKontakte**. He uses **Telegram** to communicate with his fellow activists and ephemeral online notepads (i.e. privnote.com) for sensitive communication. He uses different **VPN clients** to access VKontakte pages that are blocked in Ukraine due to sanctions on Russia, as a large part of his audience still uses the site.


## Goals

He wants to keep his true identity secret in order to **protect his job** as a teacher.

He needs to me sure that his Facebook pages are **secure** and **available** at all times.

He wants to **engage the local community** in the struggLe against gentrification and corruption of city officials.


## Threats

Several members of his group have been temporarily **arrested** in the past on fake charges and their devices were **confiscated**. Their **social media pages were deleted** after devices were confiscated by authorities. This caused them to lose a large portion of their audience.

He is afraid that his **identity will be revealed** by law enforcement or corrupt officials.


## Strengths

Maksym's devices are **password protected** and he has **2-factor authentication** enabled on all important accounts.

He uses Telegram for most conversations and privnote.com for sensitive communication.

He also uses **aliases** on all his personal social media accounts.


## Questions

Can someone **track me** using my phone number (since you do not need to register a SIM card with a specific name in Ukraine yet)?

What can I do to **protect our social media pages** from being deleted if my devices were to be seized?
