**Today, we are excited to release a compilation of these activities and resources, the [UX Feedback Collection Guidebook: Integrating Feedback Collection from High-risk Users into Existing Training Practices](https://usable.tools/guidebook).**

Many of the most at-risk communities around the globe rely on open
source privacy and security tools. However, these tools are often
designed, developed, and maintained by individuals or small teams who
have little to no access to their target audience — journalists,
activists, human rights defenders, and other high-risk groups. This
often results in tools that poorly fit the threats, challenges, and/or
accessibility or usability requirements of end-users.

The USABLE project aims to close this gap by establishing feedback loops
between the communities who make the tools and the communities who use
them.

Since 2015, USABLE has worked with over 50 trainers from around the
globe, 11 designers and UX experts, and 7 open source tool teams who
build products that focus on privacy and security for high-risk
communities to develop and test feedback collection activities. The goal
was to identify straightforward and time-efficient activities and
resources that would allow digital security trainers to integrate
feedback collection into their existing training frameworks. When done
effectively, the process of capturing and sharing feedback can transform the design and
development of the most commonly used privacy and security tools for
high-risk users.

The guidebook is broken down into four thematic sections:

*   Part I: Collecting Feedback to Better Understand the User
*   Part II: Collecting Tool-specific Feedback During Trainings
*   Part III: Collecting Feedback Outside of Trainings
*   Part IV: Communicating with Developers and Tool Teams

From background information to facilitation guides to editable
templates, the guidebook provides trainers and facilitators with the
resources required to effectively collect, synthesize, and share
valuable feedback from high-risk users with tool developers.
