His work involves **monitoring and documenting human rights violations** and corruption through digital media.

He is not very experienced in the use of technology to collect sensitive information, but he has used Signal and PGP to communicate securely with his contacts. The group he works with has some technical capacity and experience with digital security.


## Goals

Jomeo wants to continue to use the internet as a primary medium to expose corruption.

He needs to **build his capacity** to promote governance, human rights, accountability, and transparency through social media and avid blogging. He also needs to maintain a **secure** environment to protect his work and his sources.


## Threats

He is the target of **intimidation** and **harrassment** by police.

Office and home **raids** lead to the **confiscation** of phones, laptops, flash disks, modems, and soft and hard copies of documents by security operatives.

**Surveillance** is a concern, as phones have been tapped. Other concerns include **imprisonment** and degradation of the organization.


## Strengths

Jomeo has previously attended **security trainings**. He learned how to maintain strong passwords, enable 2-step verification, and how to securely communicate via encryption.

He also backs up confidential documents to ensure **safe storage**.
